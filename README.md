# Codelab: The Art of Compose
This is a sample code repository implemented using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose during my live code session at [**360Andev Conference**](https://360andev.com/sessions/code-lab-the-art-of-compose/). It follows through a simple Gmail Android app's email list screen step-by-step.

## Tools
* **Android Studio 4.2 Canary 4** - Jetpack Compose is still in preview and can only be used in Canary versions of Android Studio. You can [download the Canary versions from here](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/).
* **Jetpack Compose Dev Preview 14** - This codelab uses the [Dev Preview 14](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose#0.1.0-dev14) of Jetpack Compose. Since the API is rapidly changing during the dev previews, so its possible that this code will not work with other versions of Compose.

## Additional Materials

Here is a list of additional materials if you want to learn more about Jetpack Compose:
* [Jetpack Compose documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is a great place to start getting familiar with Compose.
* [Jetpack Compose tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial) walks through creating a UI with the essential compose components
* [Jepack Compose codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-basics) is a more in-depth look at compose. It covers dealing with state as well as how to have flexible layouts.
* [Compose release notes](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose) provides information about the changes in each release of Compose. This is a great resource since things are changing so quickly.
* [Compose UI release notes](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/ui) provides information about the changes made in the compose UI dependencies. Another great resource to look at each time the versions are bumped.
* [What's new in Jetpack Compose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm2h-_sNDQ) talk from Android Dev Summit 2019 Is a fun look at the new things available in Compose.
* [Understanding Compose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9MtlmmN4Q0) is another talk from Android Dev Summit 2019 that I recommend checking out.
